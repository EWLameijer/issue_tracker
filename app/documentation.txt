DESIGN 
Basically, an issue tracker according to Dalio (Principles) 
For now: tracking time (tracking financial damages may also be useful later on, but for now settle on one unit of damage)

Basically: report issues: date, time, // day of week is implied, damage, description. Possibly: which rule was broken?
rules: have file, each rule has an ID and a (current) formulation. Rule = situation + action (+question? Or is that inherent in the situation?)

So basically [unless I want to use a database]

File 1: issues: datetime, damage, rule 
File 2: rules: rule_id (int), + description

Interface: be able to find most important principles (most damage caused) (for)ever, this year, this month 

How it should look like 

[all times][this year][this month] // radio buttons? tabs may be nicer, but radio buttons may do for now 

1. /* rank */ 124 /* total time */ 3 /* #occurrences, important to break ties */

START WITH RULESLIST (so I have something visible)

#TODO:
1. ensure it works with more than 1 rule => SEEMS OKAY 
2. sort rules on severity
    2a. Calculate severity of a rule 
        2aI: read in issues. DONE! 20200827=15:37
        2aII: for each rule, calculate a total score based on the sum of issues referring to that rule. Show it as the second element 
    2b. Now sort rules on severity
